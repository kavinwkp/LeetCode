This paper introduces the drone routing problem with variable drone speeds (DRP-VDS), an extension of the DRP defined by \cite{cheng2020}. In this problem, a fleet of heterogeneous UAVs deliver packages to customers in the minimum traveral distance or minumum energy consumption. While the DRP and other related problems in the literature assume that UAVs fly at constant speeds, the DRP-VDS consider UAV speeds as decision variables where drones make deliveries.
