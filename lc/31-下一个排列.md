## LeetCode 31. Next Permutation

A **permutation** of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

For example, for `arr = [1,2,3]`, the following are considered permutations of `arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,1,2], [2,3,1]`.
The **next permutation** of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the **next permutation** of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

For example, the next permutation of `arr = [1,2,3]` is `[1,3,2]`.
Similarly, the next permutation of `arr = [2,3,1]` is `[3,1,2]`.
While the next permutation of `arr = [3,2,1]` is `[1,2,3]` because `[3,2,1]` does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.

The replacement must be **in place** and use only constant extra memory.

Example 1:
```cpp
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
```

### method

1. 从后往前找第一个非递增的数，即`nums[i] < nums[i+1]`
2. 从后往前找第一个大于`nums[i]`的数，即`nums[j] > nums[i]`
3. 交换`nums[i]`和`nums[j]`
4. i+1及后面的数是递减的，反转之后变成递增，保证下一个排列大于上一个排列，并且增加的幅度最小

```cpp
void nextPermutation(vector<int>& nums) {
    int i = nums.size() - 2;
    while (i >= 0 && nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
        i--;
    }
    if (i >= 0) {
        int j = nums.size() - 1;
        while (j >= 0 && nums[j] <= nums[i]) {
            j--;
        }
        swap(nums[j], nums[i]);
    }
    reverse(nums.begin() + i + 1, nums.end());
}
```
