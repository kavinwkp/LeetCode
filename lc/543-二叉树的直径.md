## LeetCode 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

Example 1:

```cpp
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
```

### method

假设左子树高度为`L`，右子树高度为`R`，则直径为`L+R+1`

```cpp
int res = 0;
int traversal(TreeNode *root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    int leftDepth = traversal(root->left);
    int rightDepth = traversal(root->right);
    res = max(res, leftDepth + rightDepth);
    return max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
}
int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
    traversal(root); 
    return res;
}
```
