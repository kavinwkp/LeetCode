## PAT 1099 Build A Binary Search Tree (30 point(s))
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

+ The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
+ The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
+ Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.



Input Specification:
Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (≤100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format left_index right_index, provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N−1, and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing, then −1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

Output Specification:
For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

Sample Input:
```cpp
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
```
Sample Output:
```cpp
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42
```

### method

利用结构体数组来存储二叉树，数组的下标就是当前节点的编号，根节点编号为0，第i个输入的两个数分别是节点i的左子树和右子树的编号

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val, left, right;
};

TreeNode node[1000];
int nums[1000];
int n;
int curson = 0; // 遍历排序后的数组

void inorder(int curIdx) {
    if (node[curIdx].left >= 0) inorder(node[curIdx].left);
    node[curIdx].val = nums[curson++];
    if (node[curIdx].right >= 0) inorder(node[curIdx].right);
}

void bfs() {
    queue<int> q;
    q.push(0);  // 根节点先入队
    while (!q.empty()) {
        auto cur = q.front();
        q.pop();
        if (cur != 0) cout << ' ';
        cout << node[cur].val;
        if (node[cur].left >= 0) q.push(node[cur].left);
        if (node[cur].right >= 0) q.push(node[cur].right);
    }
}

int main() {
    cin >> n;
    int a, b;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> a >> b;
        node[i].left = a;
        node[i].right = b;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) cin >> nums[i];
    sort(nums, nums + n);
    inorder(0);
    bfs();
    return 0;
}
```
