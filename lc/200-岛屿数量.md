## LeetCode 200. Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:
```cpp
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

### method

每次遍历到一个1，说明碰到了一个陆地，计数增加，同时把它及其相邻的陆地都变成0

```cpp
void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
    if (i < 0 || i >= grid.size() || j < 0 || j >= grid[0].size() || grid[i][j] != '1')
        return;
    grid[i][j] = '0';   // 碰到1就变成0
    dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
    dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
}
int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
    int res = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                dfs(grid, i, j);
                res++;
            }
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
